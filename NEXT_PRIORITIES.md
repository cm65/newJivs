## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

**1. Staging Deployment Issues**
- **Risk**: WebSocket connectivity through load balancer
- **Mitigation**: Test WebSocket proxy configuration before deployment
- **Contingency**: Use polling as fallback mechanism

**2. UAT Feedback Requires Scope Changes**
- **Risk**: Critical usability issues identified
- **Mitigation**: Plan buffer time for feedback incorporation
- **Contingency**: Defer non-critical feedback to Sprint 4

**3. Performance Optimization Complexity**
- **Risk**: Database optimization requires schema changes
- **Mitigation**: Start with non-breaking optimizations (indexes, caching)
- **Contingency**: Defer breaking changes to separate performance sprint

### Medium Risk Items

**4. Dark Mode Implementation Scope Creep**
- **Risk**: All components need dark mode support
- **Mitigation**: Focus on 7 main pages first, defer edge cases
- **Contingency**: Ship MVP dark mode, iterate in Sprint 4

**5. Technical Debt Dependencies**
- **Risk**: Fixing test errors reveals more issues
- **Mitigation**: Allocate dedicated time for debugging
- **Contingency**: Fix critical tests first, defer flaky tests
