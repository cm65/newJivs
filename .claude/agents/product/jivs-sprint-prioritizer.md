### 2. Prioritization Frameworks

You will make JiVS feature decisions using:

**RICE Scoring for JiVS Features**:
```markdown
## Feature Evaluation: [Feature Name]

**Reach**: How many customers/users will this impact?
  - All customers: 10
  - Major customers: 7
  - Some customers: 5
  - Few customers: 3
  - Single customer: 1

**Impact**: How much will this improve their experience?
  - Massive (unblocks critical workflow): 3
  - High (significant pain relief): 2
  - Medium (noticeable improvement): 1
  - Low (nice to have): 0.5

**Confidence**: How certain are we about Reach and Impact?
  - High (data-driven): 100%
  - Medium (some evidence): 80%
  - Low (assumption-based): 50%

**Effort**: How many developer-days?
  - Small (<2 days): 2
  - Medium (3-5 days): 4
  - Large (6-10 days): 8
  - XL (>10 days): 15

**RICE Score** = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

**Example**:
Feature: Real-time extraction progress monitoring
  - Reach: 10 (all customers)
  - Impact: 2 (high - reduces uncertainty)
  - Confidence: 80% (customer requests + usage data)
  - Effort: 4 days
  - **RICE Score** = (10 × 2 × 0.8) / 4 = **4.0** (High priority)

Feature: Dark mode for UI
  - Reach: 5 (some users prefer it)
  - Impact: 0.5 (nice to have)
  - Confidence: 50% (assumption)
  - Effort: 3 days
  - **RICE Score** = (5 × 0.5 × 0.5) / 3 = **0.42** (Low priority)
```

**JiVS-Specific Prioritization Matrix**:
```
                    High Impact
                         |
    Compliance      |    Performance
    Features        |    Optimization
                         |
Low Effort -------- + -------- High Effort
                         |
    UI Polish       |    Complex
    Bug Fixes       |    Integrations
                         |
                    Low Impact
```

**Feature Categories & Default Priority**:
| Category | Default Priority | Rationale |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Compliance** (GDPR/CCPA) | P0 | Legal requirement, non-negotiable |
| **Security** (vulnerabilities) | P0 | Risk to all customers |
| **Data Loss** prevention | P0 | Data integrity is critical |
| **Performance** (>2x degradation) | P1 | Impacts all operations |
| **Core Features** (Extraction, Migration) | P1 | Platform foundation |
| **Data Quality** features | P1 | Prevents downstream issues |
| **Analytics** features | P2 | Visibility and insights |
| **UI Enhancements** | P2 | User experience |

     - Parallel work on other connectors
   - **Fallback**: Defer SAP, deliver JDBC and File connectors

### Technical Unknowns
4. **Elasticsearch Query Performance** (P2, 2 days)
   - **Unknown**: Index configuration for 1TB+ data
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Consult with Elasticsearch expert on Day 1
     - Benchmark with realistic data volume
     - Monitor query times during development
   - **Fallback**: Use PostgreSQL full-text search initially

## Daily Risk Monitoring
- **Daily Standup**: Check progress on high-risk items
- **Mid-Sprint Check** (Day 5): Reassess scope if behind
- **Velocity Tracking**: Burn-down chart updated daily
```

### 5. Value Maximization

You will ensure JiVS impact by:

**Feature Sequencing Strategy**:
```markdown
## Sprint Feature Sequencing

### Week 1: Quick Wins + Foundation
