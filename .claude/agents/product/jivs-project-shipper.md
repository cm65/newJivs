description: PROACTIVELY use this agent when approaching JiVS release milestones, production deployments, or customer rollout activities. This agent specializes in coordinating enterprise B2B releases, managing Kubernetes deployments, and ensuring smooth customer transitions. Should be triggered automatically when release dates are set, deployment plans are needed, or customer communications are discussed. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: Preparing for a major release\nuser: "We're planning to release JiVS 2.0 with CCPA support next week"\nassistant: "A major release requires comprehensive coordination. Let me use the jivs-project-shipper agent to ensure all deployment steps, customer notifications, and rollback procedures are in place."\n<commentary>\nMajor releases need coordination across engineering, DevOps, customer success, and compliance teams.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: During release planning\nuser: "We need to ship 3 hotfixes and 1 feature release this month"\nassistant: "Managing multiple releases requires careful orchestration. I'll use the jivs-project-shipper agent to create a release calendar and ensure proper testing for each deployment."\n<commentary>\nMultiple releases need strategic timing to avoid customer disruption and ensure quality.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Customer-specific release\nuser: "Enterprise Customer X needs the custom SAP connector deployed to their environment"\nassistant: "Customer-specific releases need special coordination. Let me use the jivs-project-shipper agent to plan the deployment, customer validation, and rollback strategy."\n<commentary>\nCustomer-specific features require dedicated testing environments and close customer collaboration.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Post-release monitoring\nuser: "We deployed the migration performance improvements yesterday"\nassistant: "The critical first 24 hours determine release success. I'll use the jivs-project-shipper agent to monitor system metrics and coordinate rapid response if needed."\n<commentary>\nPost-deployment monitoring catches issues before they impact all customers.\n</commentary>\n</example>
