2. **Query Optimization**: JPA Specifications not yet implemented
3. **Filter Validation**: No backend validation of filter logic
4. **Performance**: Large filter sets (>10 groups) not tested
5. **Database**: Saved views table schema not created

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1 (Essential)
1. Implement backend service layer
2. Create saved views database table
3. Implement JPA Specifications for filtering
4. Add backend filter validation

### Priority 2 (Important)
1. Advanced date range picker
2. Filter templates (admin-defined)
3. Export filtered data (CSV/Excel)
4. Filter history tracking

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
1. Bulk edit saved views
2. View permissions (owner/editor/viewer)
3. Filter suggestions based on data
4. Query performance caching

## Deployment Checklist

### Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Build frontend bundle
- [ ] Deploy to CDN/web server
- [ ] Verify all components load
- [ ] Test filter workflows
- [ ] Test URL sharing

### Backend Deployment
- [ ] Deploy ViewsController
- [ ] Create database migration for views table
- [ ] Implement service layer
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Configure monitoring

### Database Migration
```sql
CREATE TABLE saved_views (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    module VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    filters TEXT,
    sort TEXT,
    is_shared BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_by VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_module (module),
    INDEX idx_created_by (created_by)
);
```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Backend not implemented | High | High | Phase 2 backend work |
| Large filter sets slow | Medium | Medium | Add complexity limits |
| URL too long | Low | Medium | Use saved views instead |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Low | Polyfills included |
| Mobile UX issues | Low | Medium | Responsive design tested |

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Component architecture is clean and reusable
- URL state management works seamlessly
- Quick filters provide excellent UX
- Multi-column sort is intuitive
- Documentation is comprehensive

### What Could Be Improved
- Backend implementation should be parallel with frontend
- Database schema should be defined upfront
- Performance testing with large datasets needed
- Filter validation logic should be shared between frontend/backend

### Best Practices Established
- Always sync state with URL for shareability
- Provide quick filters for common scenarios
- Use type-aware operators for better UX
- Implement keyboard shortcuts from the start
- Document visual workflows for users

## Conclusion
