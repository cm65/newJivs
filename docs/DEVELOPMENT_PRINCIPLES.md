# JiVS Platform - Development Principles

## üö® CRITICAL: Feature Isolation Principle

**ALWAYS follow this workflow when adding or modifying features:**

### Step 1: Establish Baseline ‚úÖ
```bash
# Before starting ANY work, document what's working
1. Run full test suite
2. Document passing tests/endpoints
3. Save baseline metrics
4. Commit current state to git
```

### Step 2: Plan Feature Scope üìã
```
BEFORE writing code, answer:
- What files will I CREATE? (new feature files)
- What files will I MODIFY? (only if absolutely necessary)
- What tests will I add?
- What existing features might be affected?
```

### Step 3: Implement in Isolation üîí
```
DO:
‚úÖ Create NEW files for new features
‚úÖ CHECK EXISTING SIMILAR FILES for patterns (e.g., Extractions.tsx for API calls)
‚úÖ FOLLOW ESTABLISHED CONVENTIONS (e.g., use /documents not /api/v1/documents)
‚úÖ VERIFY CONFIGURATION FILES (e.g., check apiClient.ts baseURL)
‚úÖ Add NEW endpoints for new functionality
‚úÖ Add NEW database migrations
‚úÖ Add NEW tests for new features
‚úÖ Test the NEW feature in isolation

DO NOT:
‚ùå Modify working files "just to clean up"
‚ùå "Fix" unrelated code while implementing
‚ùå Add getters/setters to existing classes unnecessarily
‚ùå Refactor existing features unless explicitly required
‚ùå Change enum values in production code
‚ùå Modify database columns that other features depend on
‚ùå Duplicate configuration that already exists elsewhere (e.g., baseURL)
‚ùå Ignore existing patterns in similar components
```

### Step 4: Test New Feature Only üß™
```bash
# Test ONLY the new feature first
1. Test new endpoints in isolation
2. Verify new functionality works
3. Check database changes applied correctly
4. Verify no compilation errors
```

### Step 5: Regression Test üîÑ
```bash
# AFTER new feature works, verify existing features
1. Run existing test suite
2. Test previously working endpoints
3. Compare with baseline from Step 1
4. If anything broke, FIX IT before proceeding
```

### Step 6: Document Changes üìù
```
Record:
- Files CREATED (new)
- Files MODIFIED (with reason)
- Tests ADDED
- Existing features VERIFIED still working
```

## Real Example: Document Archiving Feature

### ‚úÖ Correct Approach:
```
CREATED (New files only):
- DocumentController.java
- Document.java
- DocumentService.java
- DocumentRepository.java
- DocumentDTO.java
- Documents.tsx (frontend page)
- V101__Enhance_document_archiving.sql

MODIFIED (Only to fix issues in MY new code):
- Document.java - Fixed column mapping created_date ‚Üí created_at
- Documents.tsx - Fixed duplicate /api/v1 prefix (see lesson below)

TESTED:
1. Document endpoints in isolation
2. Verified existing extraction/migration/compliance endpoints still work
```

### ‚ùå Lesson Learned: Not Checking Existing Patterns

**What Went Wrong:**
When creating `Documents.tsx`, I wrote API calls like:
```typescript
apiClient.get('/api/v1/documents/statistics')  // WRONG - duplicate prefix
```

**Root Cause:**
- Failed to check `apiClient.ts` which has `baseURL: '/api/v1'`
- Failed to look at `Extractions.tsx` which uses `apiClient.get('/extractions')`
- Ignored established convention in existing code

**Correct Implementation:**
```typescript
// Step 1: CHECK apiClient.ts
// Found: baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1'

// Step 2: CHECK similar page (Extractions.tsx)
// Found: apiClient.get('/extractions')  ‚Üê No /api/v1 prefix!

// Step 3: FOLLOW the pattern
apiClient.get('/documents/statistics')  // CORRECT
```

**Impact:**
- All 8 API endpoints returned 404 errors
- Documents page showed "An unexpected error occurred"
- Wasted time debugging self-created issue

**Prevention:**
‚úÖ ALWAYS check existing similar files before writing new code
‚úÖ Look for configuration files that might affect your code
‚úÖ Follow established patterns - consistency is key
‚úÖ Test early to catch configuration errors quickly

### ‚ùå Wrong Approach (What NOT to do):
```
MODIFIED (Unnecessary changes):
- ExtractionConfig.java - Added getters (not needed, was working)
- BulkActionRequest.java - Added getters (not needed, was working)
- BulkActionResponse.java - Added builder (not needed, was working)
- RefreshTokenRequest.java - Added getters (not needed, was working)

RESULT:
- Wasted time on unnecessary changes
- Risk of breaking working features
- Distracted from actual goal (document archiving)
```

## Golden Rules üèÜ

1. **"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"**
   - Working code is sacred
   - Don't modify unless absolutely necessary

2. **"Feature isolation is safety"**
   - New features should be self-contained
   - Minimize touching existing code

3. **"Test what you touch"**
   - If you modify a file, test that feature
   - Always regression test existing features

4. **"Plan before code"**
   - Write down what files you'll create/modify
   - Get approval if modifying critical files

5. **"Baseline is your friend"**
   - Always know what was working before you started
   - Document the before state

6. **"Check existing patterns FIRST"** ‚≠ê NEW
   - Before creating new code, look at similar existing code
   - Follow established conventions and patterns
   - Example: Check how Extractions.tsx makes API calls before writing Documents.tsx
   - Check configuration files (apiClient.ts) before duplicating settings
   - Consistency prevents bugs

## Pre-Commit Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

Before committing ANY code:

- [ ] Did I only modify files necessary for this feature?
- [ ] Did I test the new feature in isolation?
- [ ] Did I verify existing features still work?
- [ ] Did I revert any unnecessary changes?
- [ ] Did I document what I changed and why?
- [ ] Would my changes break production if deployed?

## When Modifying Existing Code IS Necessary

Sometimes you MUST modify existing code. When you do:

1. **Document the reason** - Why is this modification necessary?
2. **Test extensively** - Test the modified feature thoroughly
3. **Communicate** - Inform team about changes to shared code
4. **Plan rollback** - Know how to revert if things break

Examples of valid reasons:
- ‚úÖ Bug fix in existing feature
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerability
- ‚úÖ Database schema requires backward-compatible change
- ‚úÖ API contract needs versioning
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization (after profiling)

Examples of invalid reasons:
- ‚ùå "Code looks messy"
- ‚ùå "I prefer this pattern"
- ‚ùå "Adding getters for consistency"
- ‚ùå "Fixing Lombok compilation issues" (when it's not broken)

## Emergency Rollback Procedure üö®

If you break existing features:

```bash
# 1. Immediately stop
git status

# 2. Identify what you changed
git diff

# 3. Revert unnecessary changes
git checkout -- <file-that-shouldnt-have-been-modified>

# 4. Test again
# Run test suite

# 5. If still broken, revert everything
git reset --hard HEAD

# 6. Start over with proper planning
```

## Metrics to Track

For each feature implementation:
- **Files created**: X new files
- **Files modified**: Y existing files (justify each)
- **Tests added**: Z new tests
- **Existing tests passing**: Before: A%, After: A% (should be same)
- **Time spent**: X hours (compare to estimate)

## Remember:

> **"The best code is code that doesn't break existing functionality."**
>
> **"New features should be additive, not disruptive."**
>
> **"When in doubt, test more, change less."**
